# Model Calculations Solver for some Fluid Lab Experiments

## [LIVE DEMO](https://rohit-bindal.github.io/FluidLab/)

While doing experiments of Fluid Lab in my 4th Semester (B.Tech Petroleum Engineering), I Observed that doing model calculations for atleast 10 different readings is actually time consuming and also it is waste of time as you are repeating same things again and again after your first model calculation so I made this webpage so that one can solve all the calculations easily and can save the precious time! I've done this for particular experiments which was in my syllabus (I've listed below the name of experiments).
If you want to add some more experiments then I'll be happy to merge your commit :)

|List of Experiments |

|Calibration of Rotameter |
|Friction Losses Through Pipe |
|Pressure Drop in packed bed |
|Flow Measurement with an orifice meter |
|Verficiation of Bernouli's Equation |
|Flow Measurement with Venturimeter |
|Frictional Losses Due To Pipe fittings |
|Pressure drop and void fraction in fluidised bed |
|Characteristics of Centrifugal pump |
|Frictional losses through an annulus |
